            <p id="p-text">Blogging is far from dead. As the last two years of X-formerly-Twitter drama has shown, allowing a social media platform to control your access to your audience has big risks. If you want a platform where you can share your thoughts properly and keep control of things, it's impossible to beat a blog. Plus, you can always share your blog posts on social media, through a newsletter, and anywhere else. The whole point of a blog is that it's your content to do with as you will.</p>
            <div class="content-flex">
                <aside class="c-aside">
                    <p>Promote and publish your content with automation.</p>
                    <input class="a-submit" type="submit" value="Learn how"/>
                </aside>

                    Similarly, if you run a business and want to provide resources and recommendations to customers, the best way to do it is often to add a blog to your website. Best of all, your blog content gets indexed by Google—unlike almost all social media posts—so you can drive potential customers to your business through content marketing (and without having to pay for ads). Look at the blog you're reading right now: Zapier blog posts get millions of views per month and are one of the most valuable ways of getting new customers at Zapier.
